## Background Information:

Brent – Brent Crude price is a benchmark for Atlantic basin crude oils and is used as an indicator for global crude oil prices. Brent in traded over the International Commodity Exchange. Price of Brent is determined by market demand and supply and news flow.

WTI – West Texas Intermediate is a benchmark for light and sweet crude oil. WTI is traded over the New York Mercantile Exchange. Price of WTI is determined by market demand and supply and news flow.
Discount Rate – The discount rate is the minimum lending rate set by the State Bank for lending to other banks. Discount Rate is a tool used by the Central bank for its Monetary Policy. In order to spur growth, induce consumption, and inhibit savings, a central bank usually reduces the discount rate. However, lower interest rates leads to inflationary pressure in the economy. 

KIBID – Karachi Interbank Bid Rate is the bid rate of the interest rate in the open market.

KIBOR – Karachi Interbank Offered Rate is the daily interest the rate offered in the open market bby banks to lend unsecured funds to other banks.

CPI – Consumer Price Index is a measure to see the change in prices of a basket of goods over a certain period. A positive change in CPI over a given period of time is considered as inflation and a negative change in CPI over a given period of time is considered as deflation. The weighted basket of goods or CPI comprises of goods that are consumed by people, this contains, food items, housing, fuel and other household goods and commodities.
CPI is sensitive to fuel prices, as any change in fuel prices have a direct and indirect impact on the cost of living and the prices of other goods. Fuel prices, especially oil prices, impact utilities cost, transportation cost, and a general push in prices of almost all goods and services. Therefore, the CPI is positively correlated to Brent and WTI prices. However, the CPI is negatively correlated to Discount Rate, KIBID and KIBOR.
